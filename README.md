# WhatIsCricket
This website was coded using pure HTML and CSS and is a ones-stop-shop for people who are interested in learning about the game of cricket, including cricket lovers. It contains various perspectives on the history of cricket, starting from the 18th century, until present-day. It also includes various sorts of bonus content for those who are interested in checking it out and they're linked across various pages on the website to be explored. There's also another bonus resource at the end, and while I would ideally mention what it is, I will not because I'd like everyone who gets the chance to check this website to see what it is for themselves. Feel free to share it around with your family and friends and also don't forget to check out that video at the end!
