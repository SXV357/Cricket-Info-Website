        <div class = "text-box"><strong><i>In 1909, the ICC(Imperial Cricket Conference was founded by England, Australia, and South Africa with the goal of controlling worldwide cricket. Soon, in 1928, West Indies also became members, with New Zealand and India joining pre-WW2 and Pakistan joining sometime in the 1950s.
            Starting 1965, the ICC started admitting countries that didn't have a test team, including Associate countries. The ICC became widely known as the International Cricket Conference. This was also followed by Sri Lanka being recognized as a test-playing nation in the year 1982.
         For countries that didn't have a rich cricketing background, the ICC introduced the status of being an affiliate member. In 1989, the ICC rebranded itself to be known as the International Cricket Council with Zimbabwe and Bangladesh becoming members respectively in the years 1992 and 2000. This was followed up by Afghanistan and Ireland being recognized as test-playing nations in the year 2018. This effectively increased the number of permanent members to 12. </i></strong></div>

         <div class = "text-box-left"><strong><i>Limited overs cricket began during the 1960s when certain English teams adopted the style of playing games that had a cap on the innings that could be played. The way limited-over cricket is governed is through the "List A" deployment and the advantage it had was that it was capable of appealing to the younger generation, as well as generating significant revenue for broadcasting companies. Since 1971 when the first limited overs game was played, ODIs(One-Day Internationals) have become extremely popular because of the fact that almost anybody could watch it. This also resulted in the ICC hosting the first ever CWC(Cricket World Cup) in England in the year 1975.</i></strong></div>
         <div class = "text-box-right"><strong><i>The methods used to cover limited-over cricket games were also brought into test cricket as they included statistical/visual analysis, cameras being placed inside the wickets, 360 degree cameras, fast-paced photo shooting, as well as video replays for the audience to be able to track the trajectory of a delivery. In 1992, a new concept was introduced into test cricket wherein a person called the third umpire would be responsible for examining run-outs from television replays. While their roles were quite limited at the time, nowadays third umpires have a lot more power, especially because they can make decisions regarding stumpings, regular catches, and boundary catches. In addition, starting in 2011, third umpires were given the task of checking the decision of the on-field umpires using various kinds of ball-tracking technology like the Hawk-Eye and Hot Spot, as well as the DRS camera. </i></strong></div>
