             <strong><i>
                 During the time period 1850-1890, the growth of cricket was made possible due to 
                 efforts put forth in the construction of the railway network. This not only allowed
                 various teams to play other teams, but it significantly altered travel time. This also permitted
                 audiences to travel to locations across the country and watch games, which contributed to the overall
                 number of spectators present at each time.

                    The first ever known overseas cricket game took place
                    between US and Canada prior to mid-19th century. Following a couple years
                    after 1850, the newly formed England national cricket team sailed to North America
                    in what became known as the world's first overseas series between 2 cricket-playing nations.
                    The 1st Australian cricket to travel overseas played England in the 1868 series.
                    And in the year 1877, the English national cricket team traveled to Australia and played 2 matches against the home side
                    , which became known as the 1st ever test games to be played. After Australia played England at their home grounds in 1878, they won a consecutive game at the Oval in 1882, which came to widely known as the birth of the Ashes.

                    One of the most important developments in the sport took place in 1890 as the County Championship was inaugurated in England. This was followed by Australia establishing the Sheffield Shield, South Africa establishing the Currie Cup, New Zealand establishing the Plunket Shield, and India establishing the Ranji Trophy.
                    The time period from 1890-1914 was one that was nicknamed, "The Golden Age of Cricket" because it was a time during which people witnessed the rise of some of the most famous players of the game such as Wilfred Rhodes, C.B. Fry, Ranjitsinhji, and Victor Trumper.

                <strong><i>
                For the majority of the 19th century, every over in the game was comprised of 4 balls, but in 1889, it became 5 balls, and by the start of the 20th century, it became 6 balls.
                However, in a few countries such as Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, overs consisted of 8 balls each during the time period 1918-19 and 1978-79.
                Since  Australia and New Zealand faced off against each other in the 1979-80 series, the standard number of balls per over has been 6, with the same holding true for modern-day cricket.
