            <strong><i>At the beginning of the 21st century, the ICC announced the commencement of a ranking table for both test games and ODI games for all full-time members of the ICC. This was eventually followed up with Afghanistan and Ireland becoming full-time members of the ICC, thereby increasing the total to 12 members.
            There's also another section of the ICC specifically meant for advancing cricket in continents/countries where the sport is in a relatively developing state. This includes, but is not limited to Asia, Africa, and North America. While ODI and test games were held very frequently, T-20 games were introduced later on and it not only brought in huge revenues for broadcasting companies, but also attracted thousands of people.
            The introduction of a shorter format eventually led to ICC hosting the first every ICC Twenty20 World Cup prior to 2010, which was eventually followed up by the creation of many inter-domestic cricket leagues such as the Indian Premier Leeague in 2008 in India.</i></strong>
