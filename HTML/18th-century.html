       Some of the most important patrons of the game existed during the time period from 1720-1730 and were primarily composed of aristocrats and businessmen. It was also during this time that the media started covering cricket games more frequently and this can be owed to the influence of the patrons. Some of the patrons who played a significant role in the early development of the game included the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage, Alan Brodrick, and Edwin Stead.

       The way cricket arrived in the Americas was during the English colonization in the 17th century. By the starto of the 18th century, however, it arrived in West Indies and also in India. It was soon followed by the sport arriving in Australia, New Zealand, and then South Africa. While the game was extremely popular early on in Australia and West Indies, the game sustained a rapid decline in popularity in Canada because the people living there believed it to be a sport meant for rich people.

       In the year 1664, the British parliament put into effect the Gaming Act of 1664 which allowed gamblers to make bets up to 100 pounds, which is roughly equivalent to 16,000 pounds in today's currency. While the press was granted freedom to cover cricket games in 1696, by the time they would be able to provide the viewers with sufficient coverage of the game, it would've taken roughly another 20-30 years.
